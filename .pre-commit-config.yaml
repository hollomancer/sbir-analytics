        # Use a baseline file when teams have previously accepted secrets.
        # The baseline should be committed at .secrets.baseline when appropriate.
        args: ['--baseline', '.secrets.baseline']
        # Consider setting additional args or filters per project needs.

  # Disabled git-secrets hook: install requires manual setup on developer machines; detect-secrets + local
  # grep coverage is sufficient in current workflow. Re-enable when git-secrets hook exposes a pip-friendly tag.

# Notes for maintainers:
# - Install pre-commit locally and enable hooks:
#     pip install pre-commit
#     pre-commit install
# - To scan all files (one-off), run:
#     pre-commit run --all-files
# - The detect-secrets hook uses a baseline (.secrets.baseline). When you audit and accept existing secrets
#   in the baseline, commit it. New secrets will still be flagged.
# - For CI enforcement add a job that runs `pre-commit run --all-files` on PRs (ensures all PRs are scanned even if devs skip hooks).
