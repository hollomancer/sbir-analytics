## Introduction

This specification implements Add SBIR Transition Detection Module with Patent Traceability.

The ultimate measure of SBIR program success is **technology transition** - when research funded by SBIR awards leads to follow-on government contracts, commercial products, or technology adoption. Currently, the pipeline lacks the ability to:

- **Detect successful transitions** from SBIR awards to follow-on contracts
- **Track patent-backed commercialization** where SBIR-funded research generates IP
- **Measure program effectiveness** at both award-level and company-level
- **Provide evidence-based scoring** with complete audit trails for validation
- **Enable strategic analysis** of which technologies, companies, and agencies achieve successful transition

Without transition detection, stakeholders cannot:
- Identify which SBIR investments led to real-world adoption
- Understand commercialization patterns and success factors
- Track the full innovation lifecycle (Research → Patents → Products → Contracts)
- Measure ROI and program effectiveness
- Validate transition claims with concrete evidence
- Detect technology transfer and licensing activities via patent assignments

**Critical Insight from sbir-transition-classifier:**
- **Award-level success**: 69% of awards lead to follow-on work (encouraging)
- **Company-level success**: Only 7.9% of companies achieve sustained commercialization (challenging)
- This dual perspective reveals that while individual awards often succeed, building repeatable commercialization capability is rare
