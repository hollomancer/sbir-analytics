# Patent CET keyword map (placeholder)
#
# Purpose:
#   This YAML provides a curated set of lightweight keyword groups for patent
#   feature extraction. It is intended to be loaded at runtime and supplied to
#   the patent feature extractor (keywords_map argument) and/or vectorizers.
#
# Usage (example in Python):
#   import yaml
#   from pathlib import Path
#   from src.ml.features.patent_features import extract_features
#
#   cfg = yaml.safe_load(Path("config/cet/patent_keywords.yaml").read_text())
#   keywords_map = cfg.get("cet_keywords", {})
#
#   # Per-record:
#   features = extract_features(record, keywords_map=keywords_map)
#
# Notes:
# - Keys MUST match CET taxonomy IDs wherever possible (e.g., "artificial_intelligence").
# - Phrases should be lowercased and concise; the feature extractor normalizes text to lowercase.
# - This file is a starting point; expand and tune per CET area as needed.
#
# Schema:
#   schema_version: int
#   cet_keywords:
#     <cet_id>:
#       - "keyword or short phrase"
#       - ...
#
# Change management:
# - Keep changes small and test new keywords against a sample of patent titles.
# - Record significant updates in docs/ml/cet_classifier.md.

# Implementation notes:
# - The initial code defaults to a tiny built-in map. To enable this curated map,
#   load it at runtime and pass it into the feature extractor/vectorizers.
# - Keep phrases short; long phrases reduce recall unless consistently present.
# - Avoid overly generic terms that cause false positives across multiple CETs.
