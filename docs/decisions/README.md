# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the SBIR Transition Detection ETL project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs provide a historical record of why certain technical decisions were made.

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions that:

- Have significant impact on system design or data model
- Are difficult or expensive to reverse
- Involve tradeoffs between multiple valid approaches
- Need to be communicated to current and future team members
- Might be questioned or reconsidered later

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title**: Numbered and descriptive (e.g., "ADR-001: Allow Negative Obligations")
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
3. **Context**: What is the issue we're trying to solve?
4. **Decision**: What we decided to do and why
5. **Alternatives Considered**: What other options did we evaluate?
6. **Consequences**: What are the positive, negative, and neutral outcomes?
7. **Implementation Notes**: Key implementation details
8. **References**: Related documentation and discussions

## ADR List

- [ADR-001: Allow Negative Obligation Amounts in Federal Contracts](./ADR-001-negative-obligations.md) - Accepted (2025-10-28)
