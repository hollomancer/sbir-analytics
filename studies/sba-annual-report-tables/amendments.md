# Amendments — sba-annual-report-tables

Deviations from the frozen protocol in `design.md` are recorded here, with a date and a
reason. The protocol itself is not edited after freezing.

## 2026-09-17 — protocol frozen

Initial freeze, before source capture. No amendments yet.

The start gate ("exact table definitions and report-year source files captured") is
**not** satisfied at freeze time: the SBA annual reports could not be retrieved from the
analysis environment (see `sources.yaml:targets[].retrieval_blocker`). The protocol is
frozen first deliberately, so that the definitions recovered at capture time cannot be
shaped by what the pipeline happens to produce.
